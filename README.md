# Introduction ⚒  
So TRIP MATE is a complete travel companion app, that helps the user plan their trips without any hassle of looking through thousands of google search results or beating their head with travel agents. The user simply enters their dream destination and is displayed the best hotels/attractions/restaurants sorted according to their ranking. The budget travel feature also allows them to set their budget and displays the best option available under their budget. You can also check what's the weather going to be like where you are travelling on the map.

# Inspiration ❤️
This idea came to my mind when I was planning my summer holiday and I was lost in the never-ending spiral of choices I had to make. I wished there was an app where I can just enter my destination and budget and it serves me a completely planned out trip from A-Z.
